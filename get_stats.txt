Go to usr/bin and open a file named "get_stats" (no extension) with a text editor in sudo mode. 
Inside the "get_stats" file, write this:

  #!/bin/bash
  python stats_graph.py

And in the terminal where the files resides, to change permissions:

  sudo chmod a+x get_stats

Now that you are done, enter "get_stats" to get your "day-against-time" graph plot. 
("get_stats" custom command only works when executed in the directory where "stats_graph.py" resides)
