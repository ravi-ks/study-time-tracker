Mylords! greetings.

# study-time-tracker
A tool to keep track of study time, made exclusively for my GATE'21 preparation

Steps:
  Download the driver file, compile it with a cpp-compiler (like <make gate>)
  Once the object code is ready, you are set!. Run the object file (like <./gate>)

How to use:
  Run the object file whenever you start a study session(the timer will start), and to stop the session press 'x'/'X'.
  You can do as many sessions as you want per day, which'll all be updated to your daily study time without any err.
 
To see the study-time-details open "study_logs.txt" file and keep track of your progress on study time spent!
(if you can't see the "study_logs.txt" file after running the object file, just close the home application window and reopen)

Note: I shall update this to version 3, where the data can be represented graphically, also highlighting trends on your study-time-curve, and more!

Compatibility: 
  Completely compatible on machines which runs on LINUX.
  Replacing "clear" with "cls" should make it compatible on machines running on WINDOWS (untested).
  
Keyboard interrupting (ctrl+c) while running the object file will not reflect changes to be made into the study_log file. 

Farewell.
